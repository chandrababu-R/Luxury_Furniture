# Luxury_Furniture:
A house without furniture is like a barren canvas waiting for realising its own beauty. A home sans classy furniture affords no comfort to its owners. Besides, it looks dull and cheerless. 
What is Furniture?
Furniture enjoys a long and illustrious presence in our dwellings. It changed its form and style according to the tastes of the time.Beyond any doubt, a room without furniture wears a desolate appearance. A bare living room, bedroom or any other corner of the home does not give us the comfort we seek in our surroundings. We need a cosy sofa to sit down, a comfy bed to stretch on and cabinets to arrange numerous household objects. Furniture happens to be the beautifying element of any home and also the most necessary objects of decor.
